TODOAPP

Discription
Short project of a simple todo app, can add, remove, list from a external json file, i try to use as much class as possible due to file hierarcy constrant this is the best i could do while adhearing to solid principle. In the future, i want to use tkinker to make it a somewhat physical application, and ofcourse ahearing more to solif principle espcialy interface. There not a lot of challange in this task, due to i have done a similar task in the ServerSide programming course (SAMK), so i just have to port the code from there and rewrite it to classes.

How to Install and Run the Project
You can download this from github or where you get this from, install python, and some basic package, and you can just run the main.py it should work.

How to use the project
run main.py, now you can choose between 0-3 0 = exit program 1 = add somthing 2= remove somthing 3= just list the list, if you choose 1 you have to write what do you want to add, if you choose 2, you have to write the order see in 3 which just print the json file, a neet thing in 2 is when you remove somthing i code it so that the order will be automaticaly dymatically updated ^v^ pretty cool.
